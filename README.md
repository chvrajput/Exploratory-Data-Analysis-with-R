# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-R
Data Analysis on wine data. First we merge the data of red wine and white wine then start analysing it. 
We are going to use ggplot  and ggthemes to plot the data, corrplot to find the correlation of variables, wine quality distribution  and apply random forest model and variable importance.
